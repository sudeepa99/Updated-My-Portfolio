        I am currently an IT undergraduate at Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. My passion is to become a Software Engineer because I possess the necessary skills. I am a self-motivated and dedicated undergraduate with a positive attitude toward solving challenging problems and programming. That is why I actively seek out and enroll in new courses and work with tutors in the field of IT, which I complete with great enthusiasm to further my expertise in IT.
